1. 

var = variable

Data types in Ruby:

Booleans = True or False
Numbers 
Strings = "Noel"
Arrays = ['Pluto", "Wu Tang"]
Hashes =  {school: "Crafted Minds", coach: "Faraz"}

2.

plane1 = {speed: 4,520 mph, passengers: 1, airline: "Space X"}
plane2 = {speed: 1,120 mph, passengers: 179, airline: "SAS"}
plane3 = {speed: 3,300 mph, passengers: 450, airline: "Norwegian"}

planes = [plane1, plane2, plane3 ]
planes = [2]


4 - Rspec
Initialize rspec in a folder. 

We initialize the `rspec` in the desired folder. 
Without forgeting to create a Gemfile file for our beloved 'rspec' gem sourced from http://rubygems.org'.

We do ''rspec --init''. After, we open (.rspec)  and will always contain:

--require spec_helper
--format documentation
--color

Always bundle it! 

We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then written code to make them pass. Why?

Basically because we want to make sure we have a clear "User story" to facilitate our work flow with bugs/errors.
